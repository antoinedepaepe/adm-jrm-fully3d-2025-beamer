  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> \textbf{High-fidelity 4DCT:} JRM-ADM yields artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions under irregular breathing, outperforming classical reconstruction methods.
    \item<2-> \textbf{Computational Challenges:} GPU memory and runtime remain high; future work should explore how to solve this.
    \item<3-> \textbf{Real World Challenges:} Working on real sinograms would be the best path toward clinical translation.
  \end{itemize}
